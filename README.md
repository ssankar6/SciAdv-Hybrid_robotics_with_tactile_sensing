Data, code, and results relating to the submission of "_A natural biomimetic prosthetic hand with neuromorphic tactile sensing for precise and compliant grasping_" to Science Advances. 

The "Texture_discrimination_processing.m" file, in the “Texture discrimination code” folder, details the steps of bringing in the raw texture data and performing the texture discrimination process using neuromorphic encoding and machine learning for classification. 

The tactile sensing data from the 15 every day objects are in the “Everyday object identification” folder.  The everyday objects included: apple, clementine, foam brain, stuffed octopus toy, pomegranate, stone statue, plastic cup, pineapple, stuffed racoon toy, dish sponge, metal water bottle, cardboard box, plastic cylinder, foam ball, and wood ball.
